# Titanic Dataset Analysis 🚢

## Overview 📊
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset using various data science techniques. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, and missing values were identified and filled using Pandas. The analysis includes visualizations created with Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn.

## Data Cleaning 🧹
- Missing values were filled appropriately to ensure a complete dataset for analysis.

## Data Visualization 📈
- **Bar Plots**: Used for categorical variables.
- **Histograms**: Created for numerical variables to understand their distributions.

## Key Insights from Correlation Matrix of **Fare**, **Age**, **SibSp**, and **Parch** 🔍

### 1. **Fare and Age are Weakly Correlated** 🤔
   - **Insight**: The correlation between **Fare** and **Age** is quite low, suggesting that the fare a passenger paid doesn't have a strong relationship with their age. Young and older passengers could have paid similar fares depending on their class and ticket type.

### 2. **SibSp and Parch are Moderately Correlated** 👫
   - **Insight**: **SibSp** (siblings/spouses aboard) and **Parch** (parents/children aboard) are moderately correlated, meaning passengers with more siblings or spouses tend to also travel with more parents or children. This could reflect family travel patterns on the Titanic.

### 3. **Fare and SibSp Show a Slight Negative Correlation** 💰➡️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
   - **Insight**: There is a slight negative correlation between **Fare** and **SibSp**, indicating that passengers with more siblings/spouses aboard might have paid slightly lower fares on average. This could be due to the class or ticket type chosen for family groups.

### 4. **Fare and Parch Show a Slight Negative Correlation** 💵➡️👶
   - **Insight**: There is a slight negative correlation between **Fare** and **Parch**, suggesting that passengers traveling with more parents/children might have had slightly lower fares. This may be a result of larger family bookings in lower classes.
